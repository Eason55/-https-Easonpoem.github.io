      <h4>Ambitious</h4>
      <p> I wish I were not so ambitious.
                                                     Then I can lie down on a small boat,
                                                          floating in the ocean of violets,
                                                   Sleeping with birds’jubilant voices.
I am so ambitious that there is no time for me to enjoy the flowering cherry in my yard,
The joyful memories with friends have been secretly run away.
There are a million things waiting for me,
And I will become the person who rewrites the game.
The world turned upside down,
But something precious has been secretly run away,
The lonely soul is hidden behind my enrich life.
                                              Waking up with the smells of grass,
                                          A young boy is lying under his cherry tree.
                                              If my friend’s train is arriving on time,
                                                           I would like to tell him,
                                    Nothing is more important than our sincere friendship.
